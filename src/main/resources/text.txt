Inflation in Argentina could hit 100% this year, which is the sharpest rise in prices since a period of hyperinflation
around 1990. This extreme rise happened as the world is fighting to tame soaring prices.
Many people are struggling to survive. At a garbage dump outside Buenos Aires, men waded through piles of waste to find
usable clothing and even food; they sort cardboard, plastic, and metal to sell it later. Twice as many people come to
the dump or trade their belongings in barter clubs.
People have no money left, and they are so desperate that their only choice is to barter. People exchange things like old
clothes for a bag of flour or pasta.
A century ago, <<Argentina>> was one of the worldâ€™s richest countries; however, in recent 'years', several economic crises
happened, and the country has struggled to control "inflation".
